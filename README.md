# LeetCode Daily Challenge

ðŸš€ One problem, one video, every day.

## Overview
This repository documents my journey of solving one LeetCode problem each day. For each problem, I provide:
- The problem statement
- My solution with detailed explanations
- A short video walking through my thought process
- Time and space complexity analysis

## Goals
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Master data structures and algorithms
- Build consistency in coding practice
- Create a portfolio of solutions for future reference
- Share knowledge with the community

## Structure
Each problem is organized in its own folder with:
- `solution.py` (or other language extension): Commented code solution also Link to video solution
- `problem.md`: Problem description and link

## 🔑 Java Keywords & Concepts Explained

| Keyword / Concept     | Explanation |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `class`                | Defines the structure of the solution. |
| `private static boolean` | Declares a utility method that checks for palindromes. `private` means it's only accessible within this class. `static` allows it to be called without an object. |
| `charAt()`             | Returns the character at a specific index of a string. |
| `while` loop           | Repeats logic until a condition becomes false. |
| `return`               | Exits the method and optionally passes back a result. |
| `int`                  | Represents a 32-bit integer. |
| `String`               | Object to hold a sequence of characters. |
| `x + ""`               | Converts integer `x` to a string. |
| `x % 10`               | Extracts the last digit of a number. |
| `x / 10`               | Removes the last digit of a number. |
| `!=`                   | "Not equal to" operator. |
| `||`                   | Logical OR operator. |
| `==`                   | Checks if two values are equal. |
